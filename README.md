## setup
move the `run.bat` file 1 folder out                <br/>
you need to "install" [l√∂ve2d](https://love2d.org/) <br/>
<br/>
! make shure that the `love.exe` file is in the same folder as the `.bat` file ! <br/>
! the `love.exe` file needs it's `*.dll` files !


----
## game

move with `w` `a` `s` `d` or Arrow Keys <br/>
reset with `r`                          <br/>
setting with `m`                        <br/>

## I hate this
the json file has to be where it gets executed!
- `cd xyz ; love .`
- move the Json File 1 level out
